# Lesson Chat History Feature

## Overview

The lesson chat history feature allows students to have persistent Q&A conversations with each lesson. When students ask questions about lessons, the Q&A pairs are now saved to the database and can be viewed later, even after logging out and back in.

## Problem Solved

Previously, when students asked questions about lessons:
- Questions were only displayed temporarily in the modal
- All Q&A history was lost when the modal was closed
- Students couldn't review their previous questions and answers
- No persistent storage of lesson-specific conversations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Layer

**New Table: `lesson_chat_history`**
```sql
CREATE TABLE lesson_chat_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    lesson_id INTEGER,
    user_id INTEGER,
    question TEXT,
    answer TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

**New Model: `LessonChatHistory`**
- `save_qa(lesson_id, user_id, question, answer)` - Save Q&A pair
- `get_lesson_chat_history(lesson_id, user_id)` - Retrieve chat history
- `clear_lesson_chat_history(lesson_id, user_id)` - Clear chat history

### 2. Backend API Routes

**New Routes Added:**
- `GET /api/lessons/lesson_chat_history/<lesson_id>` - Get lesson chat history
- `DELETE /api/lessons/clear_lesson_chat_history/<lesson_id>` - Clear lesson chat history

**Modified Route:**
- `POST /api/lessons/ask_question` - Now saves Q&A to chat history

### 3. Frontend Enhancements

**Enhanced Modal Features:**
- Loads existing chat history when opening lesson question modal
- Displays previous Q&A with timestamps
- Better UI with clear history button
- Improved styling for Q&A display

**New JavaScript Functions:**
- `loadLessonChatHistory(lessonId)` - Load chat history from backend
- `displayLessonChatHistory(history)` - Display chat history in modal
- `clearLessonChatHistory()` - Clear chat history with confirmation

## User Experience

### For Students:

1. **Persistent Q&A History**: All questions and answers are saved per lesson
2. **Review Previous Questions**: Can see all previous Q&A when reopening a lesson
3. **Timestamps**: Each Q&A shows when it was asked
4. **Clear History**: Option to clear all Q&A for a specific lesson
5. **Better Organization**: Q&A are displayed in chronological order

### Features:

- ✅ **Persistent Storage**: Q&A saved to database
- ✅ **Lesson-Specific**: Each lesson has its own chat history
- ✅ **User-Specific**: Each user sees only their own Q&A
- ✅ **Timestamps**: Shows when questions were asked

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- New table for lesson chat history
CREATE TABLE lesson_chat_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    lesson_id INTEGER,           -- Which lesson this Q&A belongs to
    user_id INTEGER,             -- Which user asked the question
    question TEXT,               -- The student's question
    answer TEXT,                 -- The AI's answer
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  -- When the Q&A occurred
);
```

### API Endpoints

1. **Save Q&A** (modified existing):
   ```
   POST /api/lessons/ask_question
   Body: {"lesson_id": 1, "question": "What is climate?"}
   Response: {"answer": "Climate refers to..."}
   ```

2. **Get Chat History** (new):
   ```
   GET /api/lessons/lesson_chat_history/1
   Response: {"history": [{"question": "...", "answer": "...", "created_at": "..."}]}
   ```

3. **Clear Chat History** (new):
   ```
   DELETE /api/lessons/clear_lesson_chat_history/1
   Response: {"message": "Lesson chat history cleared successfully"}
   ```

### Frontend Changes

**Modal Enhancements:**
- Added "Previous Questions" header
- Added "Clear History" button
- Improved Q&A display with timestamps
- Better styling and organization

**JavaScript Functions:**
```javascript
// Load chat history when opening modal

clearLessonChatHistory()
```

## Files Modified

### Backend Files:
1. `app/models/models.py` - Added `LessonChatHistory` model
2. `app/routes/lesson_routes.py` - Added new API routes

### Frontend Files:
1. `templates/chat.html` - Enhanced modal UI and JavaScript functions

### Test Files:
1. `test_lesson_chat_history.py` - Test script for new functionality

## Benefits

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_lesson_chat_history.py
```

This will test:
- Saving Q&A pairs to database
- Retrieving chat history
- Clearing chat history
- Data integrity and isolation

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Export Functionality**: Allow students to export their Q&A history
2. **Search Within History**: Search through previous questions
