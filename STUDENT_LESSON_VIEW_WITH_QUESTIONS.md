# Student Lesson View with Ask Question Feature

## Overview
Added a new student-specific lesson view modal that allows students to view lesson content and ask questions directly within the same interface, without needing to close the modal and open a separate question modal.

## Problem Solved
Previously, when students clicked "View" on a lesson, they would see the teacher's AI versioning modal (which was inappropriate for students) or had to use a separate "Ask Question" button that opened a different modal. This created a poor user experience where students had to switch between different modals to view content and ask questions.

## Solution
Created a role-based lesson viewing system:
- **Teachers**: See the AI versioning modal for lesson improvement
- **Students**: See a dedicated lesson view modal with integrated ask question functionality

## Features Added

### 1. **Role-Based Modal Display**
- Modified `viewLesson()` function to check user role
- Teachers see `showAIVersioning()` modal
- Students see `showStudentLessonModal()` modal

### 2. **Student Lesson View Modal**
- **Two-column layout**:
  - Left column: Lesson details and content
  - Right column: Ask question section and history
- **Lesson details section**: Shows summary, learning objectives, focus area, grade level
- **Lesson content section**: Displays formatted lesson content with markdown support
- **Ask question section**: Integrated question input and submission
- **Previous questions history**: Shows all previous Q&A for the lesson
- **Action buttons**: Download DOCX, Download PPT, Close

### 3. **Integrated Question Functionality**
- **Question input**: Textarea for students to type questions
- **Submit button**: Sends question to AI and displays answer
- **Real-time updates**: New Q&A pairs appear immediately in history
- **Loading states**: Shows spinner while processing
- **Error handling**: Displays appropriate error messages

### 4. **Question History Management**
- **Load history**: Automatically loads previous questions when modal opens
- **Display history**: Shows all previous Q&A with timestamps
- **Clear history**: Option to clear all questions for the lesson
- **Persistent storage**: Questions are saved to database and persist across sessions

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **Modified `viewLesson()` Function**
```javascript
// Check user role to show appropriate modal
const userRole = window.userInfo?.role || 'student';

if (userRole === 'teacher') {
    // Teachers see AI versioning modal
    showAIVersioning(currentVersion.id);
} else {
    // Students see lesson view modal with ask question functionality
    showStudentLessonModal(currentVersion);
}
```

#### 2. **New `showStudentLessonModal()` Function**
- Creates a comprehensive lesson view modal
- Two-column responsive layout
- Integrated question functionality
- Fullscreen support

#### 3. **New Question Functions**
- `submitStudentQuestion()`: Handles question submission
- `loadStudentLessonChatHistory()`: Loads previous questions
- `displayStudentLessonChatHistory()`: Displays question history
- `clearStudentLessonHistory()`: Clears question history

#### 4. **Updated Fullscreen Support**
- Added support for `studentLessonModal` in fullscreen toggle
- Maintains responsive design in fullscreen mode

### Backend Integration
- Uses existing `/api/lessons/ask_question` endpoint
- Uses existing `/api/lessons/lesson_chat_history/<id>` endpoint
- Uses existing `/api/lessons/clear_lesson_chat_history/<id>` endpoint
- No backend changes required - leverages existing functionality

## UI/UX Features

### Visual Design:
- **Blue-themed question section**: Clear visual distinction

### Accessibility:

- **Focus management**: Proper focus handling in modals

## Technical Benefits

### Code Organization:
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Student and teacher interfaces are separate
- ✅ **Reusable Components**: Question functionality can be reused
- ✅ **Maintainable Code**: Clear function names and structure
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout

### Performance:
- ✅ **Efficient Loading**: Only loads question history when needed
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Immediate display of new questions
- ✅ **Optimized Requests**: Uses existing API endpoints efficiently

## Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios:
1. **Student Views Lesson**: Verify student sees lesson view modal with ask question section
2. **Teacher Views Lesson**: Verify teacher sees AI versioning modal
3. **Ask Question**: Verify question submission works and answer appears
4. **Question History**: Verify previous questions load and display correctly
5. **Clear History**: Verify history can be cleared successfully
6. **Download Functions**: Verify download buttons work from lesson modal

### Edge Cases:
- Empty lesson content
- No previous questions
- Network errors during question submission
- Invalid lesson IDs
- Missing user role information

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Question Categories**: Allow students to categorize questions
2. **Question Search**: Search through previous questions
3. **Question Rating**: Allow students to rate AI answers
4. **Question Sharing**: Allow students to share questions with classmates
5. **Offline Support**: Cache questions for offline viewing
6. **Question Analytics**: Track most asked questions for teachers

## Summary

The student lesson view with ask question feature provides a seamless, integrated experience for students to view lesson content and ask questions in a single interface. This eliminates the need to switch between different modals and creates a more intuitive workflow for students while maintaining the existing teacher functionality.

The implementation is robust, user-friendly, and leverages existing backend functionality without requiring any backend changes. The role-based approach ensures that both teachers and students get the appropriate interface for their needs.
