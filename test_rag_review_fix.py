        ## Learning Objectives
        - Understand the process of photosynthesis
        - Identify the key components involved
        - Explain the importance of photosynthesis for life on Earth
        
        ## Key Concepts
        Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.
        The equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2
        
        ## Process Steps
        1. Light absorption by chlorophyll
        2. Water splitting (photolysis)
        3. Carbon dioxide fixation
        4. Glucose production
        
        ## Importance
        Photosynthesis is crucial for:
        - Producing oxygen for respiration
        - Converting CO2 to organic compounds
        - Supporting the food chain
