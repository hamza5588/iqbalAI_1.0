It provides a set of tools and components that enable developers to create powerful and efficient language models. The RAG components of LangChain include data loaders, text splitters, metadata attachment, embeddings, vector store index, retriever, query transformation, prompt template, LLM reasoning and answer generation, and output parser. Each component plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the framework.\n\nThe data loader component is responsible for loading documents, such as PDFs and DOCX files, into the framework. The text splitter component breaks down long texts into smaller, more manageable chunks. The metadata attachment component attaches relevant metadata, such as filename and page number, to each chunk. The embeddings component converts text into numeric vectors, which can be used for searching and retrieval. The vector store index component stores these embeddings and enables fast searching. The retriever component takes a user query and retrieves relevant chunks from the index. The query transformation component improves the user's query to make retrieval more effective. The prompt template component formats the retrieved content for input into a large language model. The LLM reasoning and answer generation component generates a response based on the input. Finally, the output parser component formats the response into a clean and structured output.\n\nIn conclusion, LangChain is a powerful framework for building applications that utilize large language models. Its RAG components work together to provide a comprehensive and efficient solution for text processing and retrieval. By understanding how each component works and how they interact with each other, developers can build powerful and effective language models that can be applied in a variety of real-world applications.", 'status': 'finalized', 'has_child_version': 0, 'teacher_name': 'hamza5588', 'is_original': True}] [in C:\Users\DCS\Desktop\New folder (10)\iqbalAI_1.0\app\models\models.py:477]
