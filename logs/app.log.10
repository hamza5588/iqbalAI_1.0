It supports features such as intelligent intent detection, self-correcting queries, autonomous workflow routing, and context-aware responses.\n\nThe LangGraph Workflow Engine orchestrates the entire workflow using a state-based graph. The AI Models include Groq Llama3-70B and Nomic Embeddings. The Vector Database is ChromaDB, which provides persistent vector storage and metadata filtering capabilities.\n\nThe workflow process consists of three phases: document ingestion, query processing, and response generation. The system supports various query types, including rewrite, summarize, and answer queries.\n\nThe system provides features such as query enhancement, document summarization, precise question answering, conversational interface, and advanced search. It also supports setup and installation, with configuration options and usage guides.\n\nThe system uses a TypedDict to maintain state across workflow steps. It also supports vector search implementation, memory management, and API reference.\n\nCommon issues and solutions are provided, including import errors, API key issues, ChromaDB issues, PDF processing issues, and memory issues. Performance optimization tips and debugging techniques are also discussed.\n\nThe Agentic RAG System provides a powerful, intelligent interface for document interaction that goes beyond simple search and retrieval.
