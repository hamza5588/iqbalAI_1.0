Students will learn about the different stages of the RAG pipeline, from data loading to output parsing. By the end of the lesson, students will have a comprehensive understanding of how LangChain works and its applications.', 'learning_objectives': 'ai', 'focus_area': 'Other', 'grade_level': 'College', 'content': '## Introduction to LangChain\nLangChain is a powerful framework for building retrieval-augmented-generation models. The RAG pipeline consists of several stages, including data loading, text splitting, metadata attachment, embeddings, vector store index, retriever, query transformation, prompt template, LLM reasoning and answer generation, and output parsing. Each stage plays a crucial role in generating accurate and informative responses to user queries.\n\n## Components of the LangChain RAG Pipeline\nThe LangChain RAG pipeline consists of 10 components: \n### 1. Data Loader\n### 2. Text Splitter\n### 3. Metadata Attachment\n### 4. Embeddings\n### 5. Vector Store Index\n### 6. Retriever\n### 7. Query Transformation\n### 8. Prompt Template\n### 9. LLM Reasoning and Answer Generation\n### 10. Output Parser\nEach component is designed to work together to generate high-quality responses. For example, the Data Loader loads documents in various formats, such as PDF and DOCX, while the Text Splitter breaks down long texts into smaller chunks. The Embeddings component converts text into numeric vectors for efficient searching, and the Vector Store Index stores and searches these embeddings quickly.\n\n## Conclusion and Applications\nIn conclusion, LangChain is a powerful framework for building retrieval-augmented-generation models. Its various components work together to generate accurate and informative responses to user queries. LangChain has numerous applications in natural language processing, including question answering, text summarization, and chatbots. By understanding how LangChain works and its components, students can apply this knowledge to build their own RAG models and improve the performance of their NLP systems.', 'file_name': 'LangChain and RAG Components.pdf', 'created_at': '2025-09-12 20:22:57', 'updated_at': '2025-09-12 20:22:57', 'is_public': 1, 'parent_lesson_id': 181, 'version': 1, 'draft_content': None, 'lesson_id': 'L1757365368427', 'version_number': 2, 'parent_version_id': 181, 'original_content': '## Introduction to LangChain\nLangChain is a powerful framework for building retrieval-augmented-generation models.
