It provides features such as intelligent intent detection, self-correcting queries, autonomous workflow routing, context-aware responses, and more.\n\nThe system consists of several components, including the LangGraph Workflow Engine, AI Models, Vector Database, and Memory System. It supports features such as PDF-native processing, smart query processing, multi-document support, conversational interface, and source attribution.\n\nThe system architecture consists of a high-level architecture, component interaction flow, and core components such as the LangGraph Workflow Engine, AI Models, Vector Database, and Memory System.\n\nThe core components of the system include the LangGraph Workflow Engine, AI Models, Vector Database, and Memory System. The LangGraph Workflow Engine orchestrates the entire workflow using a state-based graph. The AI Models include the Groq Llama3-70B and Nomic Embeddings. The Vector Database is ChromaDB, which provides persistent vector storage and cosine similarity search. The Memory System includes SqliteSaver for conversation persistence and an in-memory dictionary for basic chat history.\n\nThe workflow process consists of three phases: document ingestion, query processing, and response generation. The document ingestion phase involves PDF processing, text chunking, and vector generation. The query processing phase involves intent classification, query rewriting, and routing. The response generation phase involves context assembly, LLM generation, and metadata enhancement.\n\nThe system provides features such as query enhancement, document summarization, precise question answering, conversational interface, and advanced search. It also supports setup and installation, usage guide, and troubleshooting.\n\nThe system uses a TypedDict to maintain state across workflow steps. It also uses ChromaDB for vector search implementation and supports two memory modes: advanced and fallback.\n\nThe system provides an API reference for the AgenticRAGSystem class, which includes methods such as add_pdf_to_knowledge_base and chat.\n\nThe system provides troubleshooting tips for common issues such as import errors, API key issues, ChromaDB issues, PDF processing issues, and memory issues.\n\nThe Agentic RAG System provides a powerful, intelligent interface for document interaction that goes beyond simple search and retrieval. It delivers contextual, source-referenced responses while handling the complexities of natural language queries gracefully.'} [in C:\Users\DCS\Desktop\New folder (10)\iqbalAI_1.0\app\routes\lesson_routes.py:215]
