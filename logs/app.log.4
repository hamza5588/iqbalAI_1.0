Matriderm is a dermal substitute composed of elastin and collagen, which provides a scaffold for tissue regeneration.\n\nObjectives:\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Matriderm W 1 mm in reconstructive surgery, particularly in cases of burn wounds.\n\nMethods:\nThe study consisted of 31 patients who underwent reconstructive surgery using Matriderm W 1 mm. The patients were followed up for a period of 12 months, and the results were evaluated based on the quality of tissue regeneration and the rate of complications.\n\nResults:\nThe results of the study showed that Matriderm W 1 mm was effective in promoting tissue regeneration and reducing the rate of complications in reconstructive surgery. The dermal substitute provided a suitable scaffold for tissue growth, and the patients showed significant improvement in wound healing.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe use of Matriderm W 1 mm in reconstructive surgery offers several advantages, including improved tissue regeneration, reduced risk of complications, and enhanced aesthetic outcomes. The dermal substitute is particularly useful in cases of burn wounds, where the risk of scarring and contracture is high.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of Matriderm W 1 mm in reconstructive surgery, particularly in cases of burn wounds. The dermal substitute provides a suitable scaffold for tissue regeneration, and its use can lead to improved aesthetic outcomes and reduced risk of complications.\n\nThe main points and conclusions from this material provide valuable insights for understanding the topic, including the benefits and advantages of using Matriderm W 1 mm in reconstructive surgery, the importance of tissue regeneration, and the potential applications of the dermal substitute in various fields of medicine.', 'file_name': 'Lamy_Use_of_Matriderm_1_mm_in_reconstructive_surgery.31_cases_french_original_2013 (1).pdf', 'created_at': '2025-08-10 18:32:00', 'updated_at': '2025-08-10 18:32:00', 'is_public': 1, 'parent_lesson_id': 85, 'version': 3, 'teacher_name': 'hamza5588', 'is_original': False}] [in C:\Users\DCS\Desktop\New folder (10)\iqbalAI_1.0\app\models\models.py:377]
